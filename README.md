# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

In this project, I was given existing code to complete a read me generator.  The user will open the command line and enter node index.js.
Once the command line is opened, the user will answer a series of questions.  Once the user is done answering the questions, the user will be asked if they want to generate a README.md.  Once this is done, the user will be able to generate a README.md populated with the answers to his questions.
